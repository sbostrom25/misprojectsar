                <h2 class="hobby-title">Music</h2>
                <div class="hobby-text">
                    <p>Music is one of my favorite hobbies. I have been playing piano and singing for years, and have been involved in countless choirs, piano + voice recitals, singing for Church, and for all campus worship here at UMD as well.</p>
                    <p>It was such a cool experience to participate in leading the All Campus Worship event at UMD. I got to lead music with a bunch of talented students who all love the Lord and it was so fun to make those connections and help lead all who came to a deeper Encounter with Christ.</p>
                    <p>Music is important for many reasons. It brings me closer to the Lord, and is a gift He has given me so I glorify Him by using it. Music also makes me very happy and definitely speaks to me. I also like to work hard to become better at it, and the satisfaction of nailing a difficult piano piece or growing my vocal skills is such a satisfying and fun accomplishment.</p>

                <h2 class="hobby-title">Photography</h2>
                <div class="hobby-text">
                    <p>I absolutely love photography, and have for years. I love capturing a variety of different things, but my favorite as of right now is couples + weddings.</p>
                    <p>I recently was able to associate shoot a wedding for another photographer in the area, and it was so fun to be able to work with a sweet couple, and capture photos on the happiest day of their lives. The ability to create beauty through photos is such a gift and I'm so grateful to be a photographer.</p>
                    <p>Photography is important to me because I get to capture peoples joy and love for one another, as well as capturing the beauty of God's creation. I would say those two things are so important, and I'm so grateful to be someone who gets to capture them. I also LOVE the creative aspect of photography. I love coming up with new artsy ideas and growing my creativity through fun poses, prompts, photos, & editing.</p>

            <!-- Pickleball Card -->

                <h2 class="hobby-title">Pickleball</h2>
                <div class="hobby-text">
                    <p>I absolutely love pickleball. It is such a fun sport and is a great group activity to play with family + friends. I think one of the reasons I enjoy it so much is because I played tennis in high school, and once I learned how to play pickleball it was just an easier form of tennis and was easier to play with others who have never played before.</p>
                    <p>I have so many fun memories of playing pickleball with my friends and having such a good time with them. This fall, I was playing a game with friends, and I had the winning shot which was pretty memorable. I was able to place the ball perfectly so my opponent could not get it.</p>
                    <p>Pickleball is important to me because it is a sport I enjoy a lot. I love getting exercise especially while being outside and this is one way I can do that. It is a way I can connect with family and friends which is also important to me.</p>
